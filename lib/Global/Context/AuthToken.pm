=head1 NAME

Global::Context::AuthToken - an authentication token

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 OVERVIEW

Global::Context::AuthToken is a role.

AuthToken objects represent the means by which a request was authenticated and
a handle by which actions can be checked for authorization.

They have two required attributes: C<uri>, which must be a string, and
C<agent>, which must be a value pointing to the user.

It is expected that any serious use of Global::Context will use a non-trivial
AuthToken class that has more stringent requirements.
